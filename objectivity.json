    "text": "When I was a youngster until I was I was in my teens, I had the same recurring figure. Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.\n\nNow, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.\n\nOver the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.\n\nThe last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...\n\nThe dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... \"Well done. I'm proud of you.\" Then he walked away.\n\nI've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that.",

It sounds like you are a former player that already bought the game and has since discontinued your subscription.  If that is the case, then you will have no restrictions on your account.  You can even take the time to earn some platinum to use to buy CREDD with and continue your subscription that way.\n\nHere are some tips that are mainly for new players but should be helpful to returning players as well.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/3485dw/general_advice_for_a_noob/cqs849b\n\n&gt; its nice to see new nexians, so for you the same advice as al, cause these are kind of FAQ for new players:\n\n&gt; 1 go to pve server entity on NA or jabbit on EU (the pvp servers lack population, you will find more fun with us on pve)\n\n&gt; 2 activate hold to cast in your combat menu, press escape&gt;combat&gt;input options&gt; hold to cast\n\n&gt; 3 join the global channels, if you are on entity :\n\n&gt;    exile side: /chjoin lfg\n&gt;    dom side: /chjoin entitylfm\n\n&gt; to talk write /1, ask anything there the community is very welcoming\n\n&gt; 4 people tend not to use the looking for group tool, they tend to do premades so you will get faster queues if you make a group the old way, spamming in zone chat and global channels\n\n&gt; 5 when questing the xp given are tied to the class of the quest, there are 5 classes\n\n&gt; world story: gives the most exp, a must do quest Regional story: gives less than world story, do this ones too Zone story: gives a good chunk of exp but less than regional\n\n&gt; task: gives the minimal xp, dont overstay in a place doing them, just do the other 3 classes of quest and move to other hubs\n\n&gt; path quest: these dont give exp to level but to increase your path, you can come do this ones when you are level capped or do it for the sweet perks of your path for leveling (btw if you are maxed in your path these kind of quest will give xp instead)\n\n&gt; 6 Moments of opportunity are the best dps enhancer in the game, to make one interrupt a mob when he is casting something, his hp bar will turn purple abd you will do 150% of damage (for interrupt, stun him or use abilities that say \"remove x interrupt armor\"\n\n&gt; 7 there is a lot of exp enhancers to make leveling fast and smooth (but the adventure is in the journey not the destination so if you want to feel the world and not rush it just dont use them)\n\n&gt;    8% xp buff from guild\n    8% xp from flask (you can buy it with renown if your guild has unlocked this perk)\n    2% from authenticator\n    5-10% from house (at lvl 15 you will get your own house, visit it once a day to get a buff for leveling, it can be 5% or 10% depending on the day)\n    when log off leave your char into your plot, it will get rested xp (you can get more rested xp if you decorate your plot or even leave it in a fried plot who has the max decor buff)\n\n&gt; 8 dodge a lot\n\n&gt; 9 almost all in the UI is customizable, so you can move it to where you feel more comfortable, some people use forge UI as an addon for this, but there are addons out there for specific clases, cause well your interface changes a little between classes)\n\n&gt; 10 there are a tons of usefull addons, i just use strikehardmeter for dps, latency meter for get a visual of the ping and LFG Board for getting groups (like the premade group finder on wow).\n\n&gt; 11 when creating a char you can skip the first 3 levels by marking skip arkship, but if you are new i recommend not to skip it cause it will teach you some usefull things\n\n&gt; 12 join a guild, this game its better with friends to play it and guilds give good perks\n\n&gt; i think that cover the basic, good luck on nexus\n\n\nEdit: I think I should mention that drop 5 [(Invasion:Nexus)](http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-03-12-wildstars-next-big-update-invasion-nexus/) is coming within the next two months.  You may want to wait until then to use your 10 day trial if you are unsure you are ready to get back in.  \n",
